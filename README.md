[DeepQA](https://github.com/allenai/deep_qa)  is a [library](http://deep-qa.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for doing high-level NLP tasks with deep learning, particularly focused on various kinds of question answering. DeepQA is built on top of Keras and TensorFlow, and can be thought of as an interface to these systems that makes NLP easier.
